Day 2 – Basic Security Concepts (Redynox Internship)

1. FIREWALL
----------------
- A firewall is a network security tool that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Acts like a gatekeeper that blocks unwanted connections.
- Types:
  * Software firewall (on a computer)
  * Hardware firewall (network-level)
- Example: Block FTP (port 21) to prevent hackers exploiting old services.

2. ENCRYPTION (WPA2/WPA3)
--------------------------
- Encryption scrambles data into unreadable form to protect it from hackers.
- WPA2:
  * Uses AES encryption
  * Most commonly used for Wi-Fi
- WPA3:
  * More secure and modern than WPA2
  * Protects better in public Wi-Fi
- Example: WPA2 on your home Wi-Fi ensures hackers can’t sniff your internet traffic.

3. SECURE NETWORK CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------
- Steps to secure your router/network/system:
  * Change default passwords
  * Disable unused services (like FTP)
  * Apply updates and patches
  * Use strong passwords
  * Turn off insecure features like WPS
- Example: Changing the router’s default password from 'admin' to a complex one helps block unauthorized access.
