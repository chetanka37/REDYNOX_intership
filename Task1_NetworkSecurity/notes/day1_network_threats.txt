Day 1 – Network Threats (Redynox Internship)

Welcome to Task 1 of my Cyber Security Internship with Redynox. On Day 1, I explored common types of **network threats**. Below are detailed explanations in beginner-friendly language with real-world examples.

---

1. 🦠 Virus

🔹 What is it?
A virus is a malicious program that attaches itself to a legitimate file or software. It needs the user to run the infected file to activate and spread.
🔹 Real-World Example:
You download a game from an unknown source. The game runs, but behind the scenes, a virus infects your system and starts corrupting files.

🔹 Key Points:
- Needs user action to spread
- Attaches to `.exe` or `.doc` files
- Can damage data or slow down system

---

2. 🪱 Worm

🔹 What is it?
A worm is a self-replicating malware that spreads across systems and networks without any human action or host file.

🔹 Real-World Example:
A worm like “ILOVEYOU” spread via email. Just opening the email allowed it to replicate to all your contacts and affect their machines.

🔹 Key Points:
- Spreads automatically through the network
- Doesn’t need a host file
- Can slow down or crash entire networks

3. 🐴 Trojan Horse

🔹 What is it?
A Trojan is malware that pretends to be useful or harmless software but actually performs harmful actions like stealing data or opening a backdoor.

🔹 Real-World Example:
You install a fake antivirus that looks real but disables your protection and lets hackers control your computer.

🔹 Key Points:
- Disguised as legit software
- Doesn’t self-replicate
- Often used for spying or remote access

4. 🎣 Phishing

🔹 What is it?
Phishing is a cyber attack where the attacker sends fake emails or websites that appear genuine to trick users into revealing personal info.

🔹 Real-World Example:
You get an email pretending to be from your bank saying "urgent action required" with a fake login page.

🔹 Key Points:
- Involves fake emails or sites
- Tries to steal usernames, passwords, credit card info
- Creates a sense of urgency or fear

5. 🌐 DoS & DDoS Attacks

🔹 What is it?
DoS (Denial-of-Service)** and **DDoS (Distributed DoS)** attacks flood a server or website with huge amounts of traffic to crash it or slow it down.

🔹 Real-World Example:
Hackers flood a shopping website with millions of fake requests during a sale, preventing real customers from using it.

🔹 Key Points:
- DoS = from one source, DDoS = from multiple
- Disrupts services, no data is stolen
- Often used for extortion or protest

---

6. 🕵️‍♂️ Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

🔹 What is it?
An attacker secretly sits between two communicating systems (like a user and a server), intercepting and possibly altering data in real-time.

🔹 Real-World Example:
On public Wi-Fi, an attacker captures your login details as you access your email without encryption (no HTTPS).

🔹 Key Points:
- Intercepts communication between two devices
- Can read or modify data without you knowing
- Happens often on insecure networks

---

7. 📦 Packet Sniffing

🔹 What is it?
Packet sniffing is the act of capturing data packets that travel over a network to analyze their contents.

🔹 Real-World Example:
A hacker on a café Wi-Fi uses Wireshark to see what websites people are visiting and what data they’re sending (if not encrypted).

🔹 Key Points:
- Can reveal passwords, IPs, and URLs
- Used for both good (network analysis) and bad (stealing data)
- Requires tools like Wireshark

**Summary**
Understanding these threats is the first step in becoming a cybersecurity professional. Each type of threat has a different behavior and purpose, and recognizing them helps you prevent and defend against attacks.
