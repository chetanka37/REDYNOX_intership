Day 3 – Simulate and Capture Network Traffic (Redynox Internship)

----------------------------------------------------
🛠️ Tools Used:
- Terminal (ping command)
- Firefox (to visit test site)
- Wireshark (for packet capture)
- gnome-screenshot (to capture filtered traffic)

----------------------------------------------------
✅ 1. ICMP Traffic (ping)

Command used:

    ping -c 5 google.com
    OR
    ping -c 5 8.8.8.8

Explanation:
- Generates ICMP packets (Internet Control Message Protocol).
- Useful to check if the system can reach another device online.
- These packets were visible in Wireshark when the correct interface (eth0 or enp0s3) was selected and capture was started before the ping.

Filter used in Wireshark:

    icmp

----------------------------------------------------
✅ 2. DNS & HTTP Traffic

Steps:
- Opened Firefox.
- Visited test site: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/
- This generated both:
  - DNS requests (to resolve the domain name)
  - HTTP requests (GET, response headers, etc.)

Wireshark Filters used:

    dns
    http

Screenshots saved as:

    task1_dns.png
    task1_http.png

----------------------------------------------------
✅ 3. Proxy Issue Solved

Issue:
- Firefox showed "The proxy server is refusing connections"

Fix:
- In Firefox, went to about:preferences → Network Settings → changed to "No proxy" → saved and restarted browser

----------------------------------------------------
✅ 4. ICMP Not Showing – Fixed

Initial Problem:
- ICMP not visible in Wireshark

Troubleshooting:
- Verified internet by running `ping 8.8.8.8`
- Restarted Wireshark and captured on correct interface (`eth0`)
- Made sure capture started **before** running `ping`
- Applied correct filter: `icmp`

Resolved: ICMP packets successfully captured and screenshot taken.

🗂️ Screenshots Location

Moved screenshots to:

    ~/Redynox_CyberSecurity_Internship/Task1_NetworkSecurity/screenshots/

Files present:

    task1_icmp.png
    task1_dns.png

----------------------------------------------------
📋 Summary

- Simulated 3 types of traffic (ICMP, DNS, HTTP)
- Captured them using Wireshark
- Filtered and analyzed using correct filters
- Saved screenshots for final report
- Solved common beginner issues (proxy error, interface selection)
